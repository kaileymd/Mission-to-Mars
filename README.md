# Mission to Mars
This project was an introduction to webscraping and building Flask apps, particularly by customizing the resulting website with Bootstrap.

This app is designed around scraping the most recent Mars news, the related feature image, and other Mars hemisphere images, saving it in our own database using Mongo DB, then displaying it with Flask. The more complex and custom app is in the Challenge folder.
